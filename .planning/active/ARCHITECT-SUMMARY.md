# Architect Summary: Checkpoint Testing System

**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Goal:** Test GSD-NH checkpoint mode functionality  
**Project:** musikfürfirmen.de
**Total Waves:** 3 (32 tasks)

---

## Executive Summary

Created comprehensive wave plan to implement and test checkpoint functionality for GSD-NH autonomous workflows. Enables pause/resume for long-running tasks with complete validation and documentation.

---

## Wave Structure

### Wave 1: Checkpoint Schema and Creation (10 tasks)
- Create testing infrastructure
- Define checkpoint JSON schema
- Implement creation and validation scripts
- Generate test checkpoint from BUILD-STATE.json

### Wave 2: Resume Detection and State Restoration (10 tasks)  
- Detection and validation logic
- State restoration scripts
- Task skip logic
- Resume simulation (dry run)

### Wave 3: Integration Testing and Documentation (12 tasks)
- Master test suite
- Edge case testing (corruption, staleness, paths, consistency)
- Complete user and developer documentation
- Final integration verification

---

## Key Deliverables

**Scripts (15+):**
- create-checkpoint.sh, validate-checkpoint.sh, backup-checkpoint.sh
- detect-checkpoint.sh, restore-state.sh, should-skip-task.sh
- test-checkpoint-system.sh, test-corrupted.sh, test-stale.sh, test-paths.sh, test-consistency.sh

**Documentation (5):**
- CHECKPOINT-SCHEMA.md, CHECKPOINT-GUIDE.md, CHECKPOINT-DEVELOPMENT.md
- CHECKPOINT-QUICKREF.md, README.md

**Test Data:**
- CHECKPOINT-SCHEMA.json (schema definition)
- CHECKPOINT-sample.json (sample checkpoint)
- CHECKPOINT.json (generated test checkpoint)

---

## Verification Strategy

All tasks include bash verification commands:
- File existence: `test -f path/to/file`
- JSON validity: `jq empty file.json`  
- Script functionality: Execute and check output/exit code
- Content validation: `grep -q "pattern" file`

---

## Success Criteria

✅ All 32 tasks with exact file paths
✅ All tasks have verifiable bash commands
✅ Complete test coverage (positive + edge cases)
✅ Full documentation (user + developer)
✅ Integration with BUILD-STATE.json and ALL-WAVES.xml
